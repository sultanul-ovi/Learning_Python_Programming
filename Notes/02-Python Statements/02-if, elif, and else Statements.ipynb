    "\n",
    "Let's walk through the main differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python gets rid of () and {} by incorporating two main factors: a *colon* and *whitespace*. The statement is ended with a colon, and whitespace is used (indentation) to describe what takes place in case of the statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another major difference is the lack of semicolons in Python. Semicolons are used to denote statement endings in many other languages, but in Python, the end of a line is the same as the end of a statement.\n",
